    <h2>BMW M5</h2>
    <p>
       <h3>
        The BMW M5 is a high-performance version of the BMW 5 Series automobile developed by BMW's motorsport division,
        BMW M GmbH, built since 1984 with periodic interruptions. The M5 has continuously been produced in the saloon body style,
        in some countries also as an estate.The first M5 model was hand-built beginning in late 1984 on the E28 535i chassis with a 
        modified engine from the M1 that made it the fastest production saloon at the time.[4] M5 models have been produced for every generation of the 5 Series since 1984, with occasional gaps in production (1995 to 1998, 2023 to 2024).
